           - This is as lazy as possible, so the data source isn't
             queried until the client asks for a hit.
    
           - In addition to being lazy, this class is as thin as possible.
             (Who'd have thought it was possible!)
             Hits are *not* stored locally, so if a client resets
             the iteration and starts over, the same amount of work must
             be done to retrieve the hits.

             iteration (not random access)
