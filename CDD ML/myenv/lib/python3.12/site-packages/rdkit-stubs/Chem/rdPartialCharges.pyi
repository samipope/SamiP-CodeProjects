        Compute Gasteiger partial charges for molecule
        
         The charges are computed using an iterative procedure presented in 
         
         Ref : J.Gasteiger, M. Marseli, Iterative Equalization of Oribital Electronegatiity 
         A Rapid Access to Atomic Charges, Tetrahedron Vol 36 p3219 1980
         
         The computed charges are stored on each atom are stored a computed property ( under the name 
         _GasteigerCharge). In addition, each atom also stored the total charge for the implicit hydrogens 
         on the atom (under the property name _GasteigerHCharge)
         
         ARGUMENTS:
        
            - mol : the molecule of interrest
            - nIter : number of iteration (defaults to 12)
            - throwOnParamFailure : toggles whether or not an exception should be raised if parameters
              for an atom cannot be found.  If this is false (the default), all parameters for unknown
              atoms will be set to zero.  This has the effect of removing that atom from the iteration.
