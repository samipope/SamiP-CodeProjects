## Project Summary:
"Girls Just Wanna Debug" is a collaborative game project developed over two, one-week sprints using AGILE methodologies. Working with two other classmates, we leveraged GitHub for project management, tracking progress, and coordinating updates. The game offers a user-friendly interface where players can log in, sign up, or play as a guest. Players can choose from different difficulty levels, which influence the speed at which bugs fall from the top of the screen. The objective is to catch these bugs using the arrow keys, and the game becomes increasingly challenging as the bugs' speed increases. High scores are tracked, and players are rewarded with a "You Won" screen if they surpass their previous high score, while a death screen is displayed if they fail to catch the bugs in time.
