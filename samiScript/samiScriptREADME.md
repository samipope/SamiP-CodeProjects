# SamiScript

SamiScript is a custom scripting language developed in C++ designed to parse and evaluate user input for various programming constructs including arithmetic operations, boolean expressions, and conditional logic. This project showcases the ability to design and implement a parser, manage runtime evaluations, and integrate simple substitutions within expressions.

## Language:
- C++

## Key Features:
- Expression Parsing: Capable of interpreting user input into executable expressions, supporting a wide range of operations.
- Boolean Expressions: Evaluates boolean logic, allowing for complex conditional statements within scripts.
- If-Else Statements: Supports conditional branching, enabling scripts to execute code based on dynamic conditions.
- Arithmetic Operations: Handles basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.
- Simple Substitution: Supports variable substitution, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of script commands.
- Error Handling: Implements robust error management to provide clear feedback on syntax and runtime errors.

## How to Run:
1. Compile the project by running "make"
   If you run "make test" then it runs all of the tests in the ExprTest.cpp
2. After compiling, your executable "samiscript" will be made
     You can run "./samiscrpt --help" to see all options of commands

 ## Conclusion
 Developing SamiScript was not only academically enriching but also an excellent way to practically apply theoretical knowledge in compilers, interpreters, and software engineering principles. It has prepared me to tackle more complex problems in software development and deepened my understanding of how programming languages function at a fundamental level.
